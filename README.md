# Agentic Export Ops

## 🇮🇳 AI-Powered Pre-Shipment Invoice Risk Intelligence for Indian Exporters

**Agentic Export Ops** is an AI-powered pre-shipment compliance and risk-intelligence tool designed for Indian exporters.

It analyzes commercial invoice PDFs *before shipment*, extracts critical export data, evaluates compliance risks, and explains **why an invoice may be delayed, queried, or rejected by customs** — along with clear fix suggestions.

This MVP focuses on **invoice understanding + early risk detection**, helping exporters avoid costly mistakes *before goods leave the factory*.

## 🎯 The Problem (Very Real)

Indian exporters frequently face:
- ❌ Missing IEC, GSTIN, HSN, or Incoterms
- ❌ Incorrect invoice currency usage
- ❌ GST / LUT conflicts
- ❌ Manual checks with no risk visibility
- ❌ Customs queries, shipment delays, and refund blocks

👉 Even a single invoice error can delay or block an entire shipment.

## ✅ MVP Solution

Agentic Export Ops acts as a **defensive AI assistant** for exporters:

- Extracts structured data from invoice PDFs
- Identifies export-critical compliance fields
- Calculates a **customs risk score**
- Explains *what is wrong* and *what to fix*
- Predicts **likely customs actions** (query, delay, rejection)

> ⚠️ The system flags risk — **final decisions remain with the exporter** (compliance-safe by design).
